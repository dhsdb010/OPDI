PRC Data Challenge 2026

Taxi-out time prediction for 10 European airports (EUROCONTROL PRC Data Challenge 2026).

## Baseline
`taxiout.py` trains a LightGBM regressor on 2025 departures.

- Features: airport, runway, stand, aircraft type, operator, market segment, wake category,
  time of day / weekday / season, NM flight-plan times as offsets from takeoff, and traffic
  counts (departures/arrivals within ±5–60 min, same-runway departures in the previous 10/20 min).
- Validation: train on 2025 months other than Jan and Jul, score RMSE on Jan + Jul 2025.
  Result: **252 s RMSE** (mean-prediction baseline: 452 s).

```bash
pip install pandas pyarrow lightgbm scikit-learn
python taxiout.py --data /path/to/data   # needs training_2025-*.parquet, ranking.parquet, submitting.parquet
```
